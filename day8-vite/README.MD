# Vite

## Vite vs Webpack

### Vite

Takes advantage of native ES Modules. Serves directly to the browser. Uses Rollup to bundle files to production. Vite is more like a dev server. Its fast because it does not need to rebundle the project on every build.

### Webpack

Bundles all JS modules, CSS and other assets. Does this every time you make a change, which can get really slow as the app grows.
